Encryption Decryption using vigenere cipher in cpp

we have created a function which takes the plain text and a key from the user and generate a cipher text(encryption) then decrypt the cipher text using the same key(decryption) using vigenere cipher.

This is taking the choice from the user and if encryption,then inputting the plain text

entering the key to generate cipher text,if the key and plain text are in lower case then converting them into upper case

then taking the choice as decryption,we entered the cipher text we got and the key to generate the same plain text
